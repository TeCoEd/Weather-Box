IoT Weather Box



The Pimoroni Enviro+ is an excellent piece of kit that boast numerous sensors, inputs and outputs.  (Such as BME280 temperature, pressure, humidity sensor,  LTR-559 light and proximity sensor, MICS6814 analog gas sensor, ADS1015 analog to digital converter (ADC).  You can see more details here.  It even has a small 0.96 colour LCD screen.

I wanted to create a project where I could collect data from the sensors and then display this data in real time.  Thanks to @  who pointed me in the direction of Adafruit's.io. A really simple way to send data to a visualisation Dashboard which is sweet and looks cool.
